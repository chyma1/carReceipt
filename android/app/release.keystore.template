# This is a template file for the release keystore.
# To generate your own release keystore, run the generate-keystore.bat script
# or use the following command:
#
# keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias release-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
#
# For security reasons, this file should NOT be committed to version control.
# Instead, each developer should generate their own keystore for development,
# and production builds should use a securely stored keystore in CI/CD environments.
